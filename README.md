## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass(SCSS)
- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- GIT/GitHub
- PowerShell (CLI)

### What I learned

Working with SCSS animations, BEM & MediaQueries

```

  .wrapperLogo {
    position: relative;

    &:hover {
      .wrapperLogo__img {
        //ðŸš© you cannot use & becasue its parent will be hover
        opacity: 0; /* Fade out the logo */
        transform: translateY(-20px); /* Move the logo up */
      }

      .wrapperLogo__text {
        opacity: 1; /* Fade in the text */
      }
    }

    &__img {
      width: 100%; /* Adjusted size */
      transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out, opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
    }

    &__text {
      @include typography('Poppins', 700, 3rem, 1.2, color('white'));
      position: absolute;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */
      font-weight: 800;
      transition: opacity 2s ease-in-out; /* Only opacity transition */
    }
  }

And if you want to see the animation go and take a look at it, use it if you want. I just liked what Josh in https://www.joshwcomeau.com/ did probably in React study the code and try to replicate it.
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
